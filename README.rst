**WzDat** is an acronym for `Webzen <http://www.webzen.com/main>`_ **Data Analysis Toolkit** (you may pronounce it like "What's that?"), which started as an attempt to build `IPython <http://ipython.org>`_ & `Pandas <http://pandas.pydata.org>`_ based data analysis system. Major features are:

* Filter large number of files by condition(``node``, ``server``, ``date``).
* Select lines in selected files by word matching.(``find``)
* Convert lines into **Pandas**'s ``DataFrame``.
* Present IPython Notebook result to Dashboard.

Currently WzDat consists of three applications. WzDat Python Module, Dashboard and `WzDat Forwarder for Windows <https://github.com/haje01/wdfwd>`_. This repository is for WzDat Python Module & Dashboard.

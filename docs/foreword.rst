Let's say you have thousands of log files, want to find some of them which contains specific words, and provide their full paths to Pandas for more delicate analysis work. How would you do that? Some scripts or shell commands could be helpful, but the process is cumbersome and error prone to repeat everytime you get new files.

That's where WzDat comes in handy. Once WzDat python module & its compliant project are imported under the IPython notebook environment, It will pick out your target files with impressive speed even from hundreds of thounds of files.

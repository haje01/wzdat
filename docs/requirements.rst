Requirements
============

Linux System
------------

WzDat has been developed and tested on dockerized Linux(Ubuntu). You can deploy WzDat server under OSX or Windows host by using tools like Boot2Docker, but unknown defects could arise.

.. warning:: 

   Mounting directory from OSX or Windows to docker container would not work.


WzDat Solution & Project
------------------------

Before using WzDat to analyze your data, you need your **solution** and **project**. Refer :ref:`solandprj` and make your own solution & project.

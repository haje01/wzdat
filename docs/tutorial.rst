Tutorial
========

Let's have a quick glimpse of WzDat. In this tutorial, we're going to build a simple solution & project to analyze Linux Syslog.


Requirement
-----------

WzDat has been developed and tested on dockerized Linux(Ubuntu). You can deploy WzDat server under Windows by using tools like Boot2Docker, but unknown defects could arise.

.. warning:: 

   Mounting directory from OSX or Windows host would not work.
